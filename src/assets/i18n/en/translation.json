However, EVI corrects for some atmospheric conditions and canopy background noise and is more sensitive in areas with dense vegetation where NDVI values often saturate. Apart form red and near infrared bands it uses also the blue band.<br>EVI values range between -1 and 1 but it is mathematically possible to obtain larger or lower values. Valid range for vegetation is -1 to 1,25 in our product, all other values are marked as invalid. Due to this there might be some transparent pixels in this product representing those.<br>EVI used in our application is calculated from L2C Sentinel-2 imagery using EVI = 2.5 * (NIR - RED) / (NIR + 6.0 * RED - 7.5 * BLUE + 1) where NIR corresponds to band BO8, RED corresponds to band B04 and BLUE corresponds to band B02.",
