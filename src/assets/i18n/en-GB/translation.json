  "layer-0-description": "Enhanced Vegetation Index is similar to NDVI and can be used to quantify vegetation greenness. However, EVI corrects for some atmospheric conditions and canopy background noise and is more sensitive in areas with dense vegetation where NDVI values often saturate. Apart form red and near infrared bands it uses also the blue band.<br>EVI values range between -1 and 1 but it is mathematically possible to obtain larger or lower values. Valid range for vegetation is -1 to 1,25 in our product, all other values are marked as invalid. Due to this there might be some transparent pixels in this product representing those.<br>EVI used in our application is calculated from L2C Sentinel-2 imagery using EVI = 2.5 * (NIR - RED) / (NIR + 6.0 * RED - 7.5 * BLUE + 1) where NIR corresponds to band BO8, RED corresponds to band B04 and BLUE corresponds to band B02.",
  "layer-1-description": "Normalized Difference Moisture Index is used to determine vegetation water content. It is calculated as a ratio between the near infrared and short wave infrared reflectances. Near infrared light is mostly reflected by green vegetation while short wave infrared is mostly absorbed by plants with high leaf water content. NDMI always ranges from -1 to +1.<br>NDVI used in our application is calculated from L2C Sentinel-2 imagery using NIR - SWIR / NIR + SWIR where NIR corresponds to band B8A  and SWIR corresponds to band B11.",
  "layer-2-description": "The Normalized Difference Water Index is used to delineate open water features. The NDWI uses the near-infrared reflectances and green reflectances to enhance the presence of water bodies while eliminating the presence of soil and vegetation.  NDWI always ranges from -1 to +1.<br>NDWI used in our application is calculated from L2C Sentinel-2 imagery using GREEN - NIR / GREEN + NIR where NIR corresponds to band B08  and GREEN corresponds to band B03.",
  "layer-3-description": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index calculated form satellite imagery implies the greenness or vigor of the vegetation. It is calculated from red and near infrared reflectances that are mostly absorbed and reflected respectively by the green vegetation. Result of the calculation has high values over healthy green vegetaion and low over damaged vegetation, built-up areas and even negative values over water surface.<br>NDVI always ranges from -1 to +1.<br>NDVI used in our application is calculated from L2C Sentinel-2 imagery using NIR - RED / NIR + RED where NIR corresponds to band BO8  and RED corresponds to band B04."
